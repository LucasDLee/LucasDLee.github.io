                        <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
                        <p>I was born and raised in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada until the age of 10 where I spent the next four years of my life living on the island of Bermuda and in the suburbs of New York. I returned to the Lower Mainland when I turned 15 to complete my education and be closer to family. Currently, I am studying computer science at <a href="https://langara.ca/">Langara College</a> to pursue a career as a software developer.</p>
