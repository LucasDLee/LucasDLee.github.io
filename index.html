                    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada until the age of 10 where I spent the next four years of my life living on the island of Bermuda and in the suburbs of New York. I returned to the Lower Mainland when I turned 15 to complete my education and be closer to family. Currently, I am studying computer science at <a href="https://langara.ca/">Langara College</a></p>

                        <p>When I was in high school, I entered a program known as <a href="https://gameofapps.org/">Game of Apps</a> which teaches youth a simplified overview of programming, teamwork, Git, and other skills used in the industry. In the program, my team built a receipt tracker for individuals which they then would use to keep track of their budget.</p>
