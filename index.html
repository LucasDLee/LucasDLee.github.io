                    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada until the age of 10 where I spent the next four years of my life living on the island of Bermuda and in the suburbs of New York. I returned to the Lower Mainland when I turned 15 to complete my education and be closer to family. Currently, I am studying computer science at <a href="https://langara.ca/">Langara College</a></p>

                        <h4>Cycling</h4>
                        <p>When it gets warmer, I love to cycle around the region discovering new places and being out in the open.</p>

                        <p>Although I don't have a lot of time to commit to this, I do like growing fruits and vegetables.</p>

                        <p>Strategy games, especially grand-strategy games like HOI4, the Civilization series, and Stellaris. Definitely not a competitive gamer.</p>
